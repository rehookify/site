# Dates configuration

```ts
interface DPDatesUserConfig {
  mode?: 'single' | 'multiple' | 'range';
  minDate?: Date;
  maxDate?: Date;
  selectSameDate?: boolean;
  toggle?: boolean;
  limit?: number;
}
```

- `mode: 'single' | 'multiple' | 'range'` - defines how date picker behaves with days

`single` - a user can pick only 1 date

`multiple` - a user can pick unlimited number of dates until `limit` is set

`range` - a user can pick one dates range. `selectedDates` will have 2 dates

- `minDate: Date` - all dates in prop-getters before the `minDate` will be marked as disabled.

✏️ NOTE: if `minDate > NOW` - initial calendar will show the month with `minDate`

- `maxDate: Date` - all dates in prop-getters after the `maxDate` will be marked as disabled.

✏️ NOTE: if `maxDate < NOW` - initial calendar will show the month with `maxDate`

- `selectSameDate: boolean` - it allows to select same date in the `range` mode.

- `toggle: boolean` - allows a user to unselect dates.

- `limit: number` - number of dates that a user could select.

✏️ NOTE: works only with `mode: 'multiple'`
