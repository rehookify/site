# Calendar configuration

While the [dates configuration](/datepicker/dates-configuration) governs the calendar's functionality, the calendar configuration defines the calendar's appearance and visual aspects.

The calendar configuration takes the following structure:

```ts
interface DPCalendarConfig {
  mode?: 'static' | 'fluid';
  offsets?: number[];
  startDay: DPDayInteger;
}
```

## mode

The `mode` option has 2 variants **static** and **fluid**.

In the **static** mode, calendars are structured with 6 rows containing 7 days each. This layout prevents any visual jumping within the UI when transitioning between months and years.

``` text
30 31 01 02 03 04 05
06 07 08 09 10 11 12
13 14 15 16 17 18 19
20 21 22 23 24 25 26
27 28 01 02 03 04 05
06 07 08 09 10 11 12
```

In the **fluid** mode, calendars are constructed based on the day number of the first and last month date, filled by the days of the week from the previous and next months if needed. The number of rows in a calendar can differ for two neighboring months due to this dynamic arrangement.

``` text
30 31 01 02 03 04 05
06 07 08 09 10 11 12
13 14 15 16 17 18 19
20 21 22 23 24 25 26
27 28 01 02 03 04 05
```

## offsets

The `offsets` option enables the addition of extra [Calendars](/datepicker/state-data#calendars).

The initial calendar is always **[0]**, followed by any provided offsets. These offset values are calculated based on the current month and can be negative, such as **-1**, which adds a month before the current one.

For instance, using offsets: **[-1, 1]** when the current month is November 2023 would result in three calendars: `October, November, December`.

## startDay

The **startDay** property specifies the starting day of the week for the calendar. It takes a number from **0** to **6**, where 0 represents Sunday and 6 represents Saturday.
