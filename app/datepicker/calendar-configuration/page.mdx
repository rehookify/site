# Calendar configuration

```ts
interface DPCalendarConfig {
  mode?: 'static' | 'fluid';
  offsets?: number[];
  startDay: DPDayInteger;
}
```

- `mode: 'static' | 'fluid'` controls how calendar will look like

Calendars in `static` mode have 6 rows by 7 days. This prevents UI from jumping while switching between months and years.

27 28 01 02 03 04 05

```

Calendars in `fluid` mode counts start and end offsets.

- `offsets: number[]` - adds additional calendars to the [Calendars](/datepicker/state-data#calendars);

The first calendar is always `[0]` - offsets comes next.

The values of offsets could be negative, `-1`, this will add month before current.

`offsets: [-1, 1]` gives you 3 calendars `November, October, December` (today is November 2022).

`startDay` - The day of the week that will be the first in the calendar. It accepts a number in the range of 0-6, where 0 represents Sunday and 6 represents Saturday.
