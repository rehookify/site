# Years configuration

The years configuration governs the behavior and appearance of the years picker.

Here's its interface:

```ts
interface DPYearsConfig {
  mode: 'decade' | 'fluid';
  numberOfYears: number;
  step: number;
}
```

## mode

The **mode** option determines how the current year will be centered inside the years matrix.

For the **decade** value, it calculates the current decade (e.g., for 2022, it represents 2020-2029) and adds the end of the previous decade and the start of the next decade.

```text
2019 2020 2021
2022 2023 2024
2025 2026 2027
2028 2029 2030
```

In **fluid** mode, the years place the current year in the middle of the list, but offset by -1.

```text
2017 2018 2019
2020 2021 2022
2023 2024 2025
2026 2027 2028
```

In **exact** mode, the current year is placed at the end of the list.

```text
2012 2013 2014
2015 2016 2017
2018 2019 2020
2021 2022 2023
```

## numberOfYears

The **numberOfYears** property determines the quantity of years displayed in the years matrix, with a default value set at **12**.

## step

The step property specifies the number of years that the [previousYearsButton](/datepicker/state-prop-getters#previousyearbutton) and [nextYearsButton](/datepicker/state-prop-getters#nextyearbutton) prop-getters will change by on a single step.
