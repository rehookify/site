# State prop-getters

A [prop-getters](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-give-rendering-control-to-users-with-prop-getters) pattern grants access to essential props and logic for components. It provides the flexibility to pass additional configurations. In `@rehookify/datepicker`, prop-getters like **onClick** are composed to receive parameters such as **event** and **date** when invoked, typically in the format `onClick(event, date)`.

Each **prop-getter** accommodates a configuration object, enhancing the properties and functionalities of the associated component. This configuration allows for customization and additional control over the prop-getter's behavior and output.

```ts
export interface DPPropsGetterConfig extends Record<string, unknown> {
  onClick?(evt?: MouseEvent<HTMLElement>, date?: Date): void;
  disabled?: boolean;
}
```

All prop-getters function similarly: they take a data entity and a configuration as arguments and return an object comprising specific properties designed to cater to the component's needs:

```ts
export interface DPPropGetter extends Record<string, unknown> {
  role: 'button';
  tabIndex: number;
  disabled?: boolean;
  'aria-disabled'?: boolean;
  'aria-selected'?: boolean;
  onClick?(evt: MouseEvent<HTMLElement>): void;
}
```

## dayButton

The **dayButton** produces properties for calendar days and sets the `selectedDates` state when a user clicks on a day.

```ts
type DayButton = (
  day: DPDay,
  config?: DPPropsGetterConfig
) => DPPropGetter;
```

You could get the `day` from the [calendars state data](/datepicker/state-data#calendars).

⚠️ NOTE: `onMouseMove` additionaly appears only if dates mode is `range`, it is not composable you can enable this mode in the [dates configuration](/datepicker/dates-configuration).

## monthButton

The **monthButton** prop-getter generates properties associated with calendar months and facilitates the month-changing functionality when a user clicks on a specific month.

```ts
type MonthButton = (
  month: DPMonth,
  config?: DPPropsGetterConfig
) => DPPropGetter;
```

You could get the `month` from the [months state data](/datepicker/state-data#months).

## yearButton

The **yearButton** prop-getter generates properties related to calendar years and facilitates the modification of the offsetDate's year when a user clicks on a particular year.

```ts
type YearButton = (
  year: DPYear,
  config?: DPPropsGetterConfig
) => DPPropGetter;
```

You can get year from the [years state data](/datepicker/state-data#years).

## nextYearsButton and previousYearsButton

The **nextYearsButton** and **previousYearsButton** prop-getters allow for the movement of year pagination, advancing one step forward or backward, respectively, within the datepicker interface.

⚠️ NOTE: The `onClick` callback function doesn't get `date` as a second parameter.

## timeButton

The `timeButton` produces properties for time button and changes corresponding `selectedDate` and `focusDate`.

```ts
type TimeButton = (
  time: DPTime,
  config?: DPPropsGetterConfig,
) => DPPropGetter;
```

You could ge the **time** from the [time state data](/datepicker/state-data#time).

⚠️ NOTE: `onClick` - callback function doesn't get `date` as a second parameter.

## setOffset

The `setOffset` moves offset to passed date if it is after than minDate and before maxDate.

The **setOffset** prop-getter facilitates the movement of the offset to the specified date. When using the **setOffset**, the provided date must fall within the constraints set by the `minDate` and `maxDate` boundaries specified within the [dates configuration](/datepicker/dates-configuration).

```ts
type SetOffset = (
  date: Date,
  config?: DPPropsGetterConfig
) => DPPropGetter;
```

The **date** param should be a valid EcmaScript Date.

## addOffset and subtractOffset

Both **addOffset** and **subtractOffset** prop-getters enable moving the offsetDate forward or backward by a specified number of days, months, and years. The first parameter, offsetValue, adheres to the following structure:

```ts
interface DPOffsetValue {
  days?: number;
  months?: number;
  years?: number;
}
```

This structure includes optional values for the number of days, months, and years by which the offsetDate should be adjusted.

Both addOffset and subtractOffset prop-getters share identical signatures, enabling consistent usage.

```ts
type AddOffset = (
  offsetValue: DPOffsetValue,
  config?: DPPropsGetterConfig,
) => DPPropGetter;

type SubtractOffset = (
  offsetValue: DPOffsetValue,
  config?: DPPropsGetterConfig,
) => DPPropGetter;
```

⚠️ NOTE: For both the **subtractOffset** and **addOffset** prop-getters, positive values should be provided in the OffsetValue object. For instance, `{ days: 1, months: 1, years: 1 }`.
