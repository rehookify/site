# State data

The **data** structure encompasses all entities available for utilization within the datepicker:

This structure includes:

```ts
interface DPData {
  calendars: Calendar[];
  formattedDates: Date[];
  months: CalendarMonth[];
  selectedDates: Date[];
  time: Time[];
  weekDays: string[];
  years: CalendarYears[];
}
```

## calendars

The `calendars` array consists of objects containing **year**, **month**, and **days** properties. It inherently includes at least one member - the initial calendar denoted by `calendars[0]`. Modifying the behavior of calendars is achieved by adjusting the [dates configuration](/datepicker/dates-configuration), while their appearance can be customized through the [calendars configuration](/datepicker/calendars-configuration).

```ts
export type DPDayRange =
  | 'in-range'
  | 'range-start'
  | 'range-end'
  | 'range-start range-end'
  | 'will-be-in-range'
  | 'will-be-range-start'
  | 'will-be-range-end'
  | '';

interface DPDay {
  $date: Date;
  active: boolean;
  day: string;
  disabled: boolean;
  inCurrentMonth: boolean;
  now: boolean;
  range: DPDayRange;
  selected: boolean;
}

interface DPCalendar {
  days: DPDay[];
  month: string;
  year: string;
}
```

## weekDays

The **weekDays** represent an array containing day names (**Mon**, **Tue**, **Wed**, and so on). The format of these names can be altered using the `locale.weekdays` property within the [locale configuration](/datepicker/locale-configuration).

```ts
type DPWeekdays = string[];
```

## months

The **months** array comprises objects with properties **$date**, **active**, **disabled**, **month**, **now**, and **selected**. The format for the month names can be modified using the `locale.monthName` property within the [locale configuration](/datepicker/locale-configuration).

```ts
interface DPMonth {
  $date: Date;
  active: boolean;
  disabled: boolean;
  month: string;
  now: boolean;
  selected: boolean;
}
```

## years

Years are an array of objects with **$date**, **active**, **disabled**, **now**, **selected** and **year** properties. You can change the year name format by changing `locale.year` in the [locale configuration](/datepicker/locale-configuration).

The years array contains objects featuring properties such as **$date**, **active**, **disabled**, **now**, **selected**, and **year**. Adjusting the format of year names can be achieved by modifying the `locale.year` property within the [locale configuration](/datepicker/locale-configuration).

```ts
interface DPYear {
  $date: Date;
  active: boolean;
  disabled: boolean;
  now: boolean;
  selected: boolean;
  year: number;
}
```

## selectedDates

The `selectedDates` array holds the raw selected dates, corresponding to the dates passed within the configuration.

```ts
type SelectedDates = Date[];
```

## formattedDates

An array of formatted dates `date.toLocaleDateString(locale, options)` you can change it by specify [locale](/datepicker/locale-configuration#locale) and [options](/datepicker/locale-configuration#options).

```ts
type FormattedDates = string[];
```

## time

The **time** array consists of objects featuring properties like **$date**, **disabled**, **now**, **selected**, and **value**. For adjusting the time format, properties like [hour12, hour, minute and second](/datepicker/locale-configuration#hour-minute-second-and-hour12) within the Locale configuration can be utilized.

```ts
export interface DPTime {
  $date: Date;
  now: boolean;
  disabled: boolean;
  selected: boolean;
  time: string;
}
```
