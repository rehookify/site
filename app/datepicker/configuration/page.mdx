# Configuration

To attain the desired behavior and functionality, the datepicker requires configuration. While we've covered the basics in our[tutorials](/datepicker/tutorials), [all-in-one solution](/datepicker/all-ino-one), and [modular hooks solution](/datepicker/using-modular-hooks), there's much more the datepicker can offer through various configurations.

The `useDatePicker`, `DatePickerProvider`, `useDatePickerState`, and `DatePickerStateProvider` functions all accept the same configuration object. This object comprises several parts:

- [dates configuration](/datepicker/dates-configuration)
- [calendar configuration](/datepicker/calendar-configuration)
- [locale configuration](/datepicker/locale-configuration)
- [exclude configuration](/datepicker/locale-configuration)
- [years configuration](/datepicker/locale-configuration)
- [time configuration](/datepicker/years-configuration)

In this guide, we'll delve into describing how to provide a general configuration and showcase the default configuration values.

## General configuration

```ts
  selectedDates: Date[];
  onDatesChange(d: Date[]): void;
  focusDate?: Date | undefined;
  offsetDate?: Date;
  onOffsetChange?: (d: Date) => void;
```

The datepicker is a [controlled component](/datepicker/tutorials#controlled-component) and `selectedDates` and `onDatesChange` are required fields for the genaral configuration.

A most common setup is to use the `useState` hook to handle updates.

```tsx
const [selectedDates, onDatesChange] = useState<Date[]>([]);
const { data } = useDatePicker({
  selectedDates,
  onDatesChange,
})
```

The `focusDate` serves as the initial value for the time-picker. If it is **undefined** or absent in the `selectedDates` array, all time buttons will be disabled.

Additionally, you have the option to include an `offsetDate` and an `onOffsetChange` function to manage the offset. This feature proves particularly useful when integrating the date-picker with an input field, managing offset in multiple modes, or synchronizing date selection with offset management.

If neither `offsetDate` nor `onOffsetChange` is provided, the date-picker will handle it internally.

## Default configuration value

If no configuration is provided, the datepicker will default to the values listed below:

```ts
const config: DPConfig = {
  focusDate: undefined,
  offsetDate: new Date(),
  onOffsetChange: undefined,
  dates: {
    limit: undefined,
    mode: 'single',
    minDate: undefined,
    maxDate: undefined,
    selectedDates: [],
    selectSameDate: false,
    toggle: false,
  },
  calendar: {
    mode: 'static',
    offsets: [0],
  },
  exclude: {
    day: [],
    date: [],
  },
  locale: {
    locale: 'en-GB',
    day: '2-digit',
    year: 'numeric',
    weekday: 'short',
    monthName: 'long',
    hour: '2-digit',
    minute: '2-digit',
    hour12: undefined,
    second: undefined,
  },
  time: {
    interval: 30,
    minTime: undefined,
    maxTime: undefined,
  },
  years: {
    mode: 'decade',
    numberOfYears: 12;
    step: 10,
  },
}
```
