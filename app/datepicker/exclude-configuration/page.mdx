# Exclude configuration

The exclude configuration enables the marking of dates as disabled at the configuration level. Moreover, achieving the same behavior is possible by passing `disabled: true` to the [dayButton](/datepicker/state-prop-getters#daybutton) prop-getter.

The exclude configuration follows this structure:

```ts
// The days in JS Date object has numbers from 0 - Sun to 6 - Sat
export interface DPExcludeConfig {
  day?: 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6;
  date?: Date[];
}
```

## day

The **day** property consists of an array of day numbers ranging from 0 to 6. For instance, specifying **[0, 6]** will disable all Sundays and Saturdays.

## date

The **date** property comprises an array of EcmaScript Dates. It utilizes an exact match to determine which dates will be disabled.
