# Time configuration

The time configuration governs the behavior of the time picker. For adjusting the time format between 24-hours or 12-hours, you can modify this setting within the [locale configuration](/datepicker/locale-configuration).

Here's its structure and types:

```ts
export interface DPTimeLimit {
  h: number;
  m: number;
}

export interface DPTimeConfig {
  interval: number;
  minTime: DPTimeLimit;
  maxTime: DPTimeLimit;
  useLocales: boolean;
}
```

## interval

The **interval** property defines the time segments in minutes. It determines the number of values available in a 24-hour day based on the specified interval. For instance, if the interval is set to 30, there will be 48 segments, allowing for 2 segments within each hour.

## minTime and maxTime


The `minTime` and `maxTime` properties set limits for the time picker:

- **minTime**: Disables all times in the prop-getters before the specified `minTime`.
- **maxTime**: Disables all times in the prop-getters after the specified `maxTime`.

## useLocales

The **useLocales** property, when set to true, utilizes `Date.getLocaleTimeString` to format time. However, enabling this flag might result in performance issues. Due to reported performance concerns, it has been disabled by default.

While the library provides its own 12-hour converter implementation, enabling the `useLocales` flag, coupled with [locale configuration](/datepicker/locale-configuration), allows for accommodating various other specific use cases related to time formatting.
